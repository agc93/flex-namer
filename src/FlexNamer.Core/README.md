# FlexNamer.Core

This library is the core abstractions for the FlexNamer utility. FlexNamer is a simple command-line utility to quickly perform automated renaming of files according to dynamic naming formats.

> This project is rough, highly unpolished, and is really just a personal project being unceremoniously thrown into the world in case anyone else finds it useful.

This package is only needed to build your own formats for FlexNamer, that you can build into plugins for use with the CLI. More details are available in [the docs available here](https://agc93.github.io/flex-namer/docs/).
