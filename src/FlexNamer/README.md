# FlexNamer

This is the command-line interface (CLI) for FlexNamer. You can use this CLI to quickly perform automated renaming of files according to dynamic naming formats.

> This tool is rough, highly unpolished, and is really just a personal project being unceremoniously thrown into the world in case anyone else finds it useful.

You can find a quick start guide to quickly get you up and running with the FlexNamer CLI [here](https://agc93.github.io/flex-namer/docs/introduction).
